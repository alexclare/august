Eternal August
--------------
Many people complain about the "Eternal September" effect that changes the
dynamic of online discourse; for example, new users flocking to a once-golden
forum only to fill it up with a...different material.

In the hopes of curbing that effect, this is "Eternal August", forum software
that limits a user's exposure to the entire community. Users will only see
conversations initiated by those who joined the forum around the time that they
did. Ideally, this will preserve some of that initial experience, and perhaps
their idea of the community will not change over longer periods of time. But at
what cost?
